Offline Localization using Belief Propagation

This class estimates unknown positions on a grid using belief propagation, 
which updates probabilities based on distance measurements from known points. 
It is useful for localization in sensor networks, robotics, and autonomous 
vehicle tracking.

Key Features:
- Uses a grid-based belief system to refine position estimates.
- Updates beliefs with Gaussian probability based on measured distances.
- Identifies likely positions by selecting the highest belief value.

This approach is particularly effective in noisy environments where 
measurements are uncertain, and adjusting the grid resolution and noise 
parameters can improve accuracy.
